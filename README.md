Daikibo_Telemetry_Analysis
Project from Deloitte Virtual Internship (Forage)
Analysis of machine telemetry data to identify downtime patterns in machines at Daikibo-Factory locations.

📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage, simulating a real-world data analysis scenario in a manufacturing context. 
The goal was to analyze telemetry data to understand downtime occurrences in production machines and deliver actionable insights.

🔍 Objective
Analyze machine telemetry data for the Daikibo-Factory sites.
Identify and quantify periods of downtime.
Provide a foundation for optimizing operational efficiency.

Tools Used
Tableau
Analysis Techniques
Time series segmentation
Root cause inference
Downtime duration calculation

📊 Key Findings
Laser Cut and Laser Welding machines experienced measurable periods of downtime in Daikbo-factory-Seiko site.
Patterns suggest downtime often clusters around specific time intervals and may be linked to operational cycles or maintenance events.
Visual breakdowns and time-based filtering allowed for clearer interpretation of peak inefficiencies.

🧠 What I Learned
How to work with real-world machine telemetry data.
The importance of data preprocessing for accurate downtime analysis.
How analytics supports business decisions in manufacturing.

📌 Acknowledgements
Thanks to Deloitte and Forage for providing this insightful virtual experience simulating real-life analytics consulting work.
